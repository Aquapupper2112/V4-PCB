# V4-PCB
If you have any questions find me on the discord

Honestly right now I'm working on this in my free time so if people really want these boards I'll expedite the process

V1 - functional but big and esp32 pins on one side needed to be bent

V2 - Will be smaller and easier to solder 

     V2.1 - will be crimp version (one signal line per pot with one 3 line connection for final pot -> board connection)
     
     V2.2 - will be non-crimp version (all pins will have direct connection to board)
     
     V2.3 - V2.1 but with a secondary board that allows for a much cleaner connection between the boards and glove
